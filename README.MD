Brainfuck in NASM-flavoured x86 assembly
---
This is just my attempt at making a brainfuck interpreter in x86 NASM assembly. This was made for purely educational purporses, mainly seeing how sructs would be interpreted in memory, using more local variables and using the CDECL convention.

TODO:
- Organize the project more
- Add more tests
- Make it compatible with C (WIP)


Usage
---
```bash
./compile.bat

cd ./src
./main
```
